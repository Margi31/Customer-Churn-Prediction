📍Customer Churn Prediction

--> Problem Statement

- The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict customer churn 
for a subscription-based service. By analyzing historical data, the model identifies customers at risk of discontinuing their services.
These insights will help businesses implement retention strategies, reduce churn, and improve customer satisfaction.

--> Goals and Objectives

Predict whether a customer will churn (exit) based on historical data.
Perform data preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical data.
  
Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models including:
- Random Forest Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost Classifier

Analyze model performance using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.
Visualize and interpret feature importance using Random Forest to understand key churn factors.

--> Dataset Description

The dataset used for this project is the Churn_Modelling.csv dataset, which contains customer information from a bank. The dataset includes the following columns:
RowNumber: Unique identifier
CustomerId: Customer's ID
Surname: Customer's surname
CreditScore: Credit score of the customer
Geography: Country of the customer
Gender: Gender of the customer
Age: Age of the customer
Tenure: Number of years the customer has been with the bank
Balance: Bank account balance
NumOfProducts: Number of products held by the customer
HasCrCard: Whether the customer has a credit card (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
IsActiveMember: Whether the customer is an active bank member (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
EstimatedSalary: Estimated annual salary
Exited: Whether the customer has exited (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

--> Tools and Libraries Used

- Python for implementation
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization
- Scikit-Learn for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation
- XGBoost for gradient boosting model training

--> Project Steps

1. Data Loading: Import the dataset using Pandas.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform analysis to understand data distributions and detect missing values.
3. Data Cleaning: Handle missing values using appropriate imputation methods.
4. Feature Engineering: Encode categorical variables using Label Encoding.
5. Data Splitting: Split the data into training and testing sets.
6. Feature Scaling: Apply StandardScaler to normalize features.
7. Model Training: Train four models - Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, and XGBoost.
8. Evaluation: Evaluate models using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.
9. Feature Importance: Visualize important features using Random Forest.

## 📊 Results and Insights
- The **Random Forest Classifier** achieved the highest accuracy, making it the most effective model.
- Key factors contributing to churn were identified using feature importance, such as credit score, number of products, and customer age.
- Businesses can use these insights to reduce churn by targeting at-risk customers with personalized offers.
