# Customer-Churn-Prediction
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service. By analyzing historical data, the model identifies customers at risk of discontinuing their services. These insights will help businesses implement retention strategies, reduce churn, and improve customer satisfaction.
